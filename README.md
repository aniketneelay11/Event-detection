In this project, we utilized data from the Belle-II detector to develop a predictive model capable of identifying the type of event that will occur. To address the high dimensionality of the dataset, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to extract the most significant features. The transformed data was then used to train a Logistic Regression model. Model performance was assessed using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC), providing a quantitative measure of its classification accuracy.
